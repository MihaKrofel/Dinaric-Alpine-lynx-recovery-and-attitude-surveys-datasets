Supplementary Datasets for paper Krofel et al. (in review) Multidisciplinary monitoring and stakeholder engagement support large carnivore restoration in human-dominated landscape

Dataset1: Data of GPS-collared animals (translocated lynx, F1 offspring of translocated lynx, remnant lynx) used in the study with their origin/translocation information, status and mortality causes, telemetry data, home range sizes, detected reproduction and predation in Croatia, Italy and Slovenia. We did not include lynx collared only with VHF collars. In our study we also did not consider the rehabilitated orphan lynx from the Dinaric population released in Croatia (n=2) and Italy (n=1), all of which died or disappeared before the end of the GPS-tracking period. Note that data for one remnant individual (ID=Mihec) that was captured twice and tracked in two session 10 years apart (once as subadult, once as older adult) are provided in two separate lines.

Dataset2: Data of responses to questionnaire including 48 questions used to measure public attitudes in Croatia, Italy and Slovenia.
